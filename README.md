<h1 align="center">Best Reads</h1>

This project is created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is based on the Amazon Good Reads application in style, using The Open Library API to create a Full Stack Application with features for logged-in users to search and review books; store books on shelves: want to read, reading and read; and finally create and read e-books using a built-in e-reader.
